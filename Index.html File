      <div class="question">
        What exactly in STEM?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        STEM Education, at its core, simply means educating students in four specific disciplines, namely,
        Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (collectively shortened as STEM). Instead of training
        students in any one of these domains, STEM combines all four in an interdisciplinary and applied
        approach, so as to better equip students to have a career and considering real-world applications.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Understanding the STEM problem
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Women and non-binary continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and
        math (STEM). Gender discrimination and gender bias reinforce cultural stereotypes about women and their
        ability to perform in male-dominated STEM fields. Greater policy intervention can bolster national
        response to
        gender-based harassment and discrimination. There are four major efforts that individual institutions,
        local
        governments, and the federal government can support to combat gender discrimination in STEM: (1) invest
        in
        early education initiatives for increasing female representation,(2) institute stronger state and
        federal
        policies around gender discrimination, (3) foster workplace practices that promote diversity, and (4)
        develop
        better quantification and metrics for assessing gender discrimination to enact more meaningful policies.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Gender issue in Education for Science and Technology
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Girls and women remain substantially under-represented in mathematics, science, and technology in school
        and in the workplace. Although this problem is recognized, its complexity is widely underestimated and
        causes are not well understood. We review prevailing explanations, which tend to concentrate either on
        possible gender differentials in qualities such as self-confidence, or on school practices that allow
        boys
        to dominate classroom interaction and monopolize such technology as computers.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        How LGBTQ+ scientists would like to be included and welcomed in STEM workplaces?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        ‘Invisible’: that is how many scientists from sexual and gender minorities (LGBT+) describe their status
        at their institution, laboratory, classroom or office. Sexual orientation and sexual and gender identity
        are not common topics of conversation in many science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
        workplaces, and these scientists argue that they should be. They say that cloaking an important part of
        their identity at work can have dangerous consequences for mental health and career advancement, both
        for
        individual scientists and for the disciplines that could drive them away.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        How to make STEM a safe place for trans and non-binary people?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        it’s time for STEM to invest in the trans and non-binary community. If your company or university
        doesn’t
        have trans or non-binary representation then there’s a good chance you’re unintentionally promoting a
        heteronormative, cisgender-oriented community. Because there’s a lot more trans and non-binary people
        out
        there than you think. If you’re not leaving the light on you shouldn’t be surprised when you can’t find
        them.
        <br>
        There’s a silver lining though. Workplaces and research labs that do decide to create safe spaces for
        trans and non-binary people stand a pretty good chance of finding out they’ve actually been there all
        along.
